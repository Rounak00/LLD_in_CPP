
In network each device have many network layers but under them only two layers are important
1. Application layer
2. Transport Layer 

Application Layer -> 
   1. Client - Server protocols -> HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Web socket
   2. Peer 2  Peer -> Web RTC

Transport layer -> 
   1. TCP -> Send data packedts with sequesnce with proper acknowldege
   2. UDP -> Send data packets on spot no sequesnce also no acknowldege (Web RTC uses it)


HTTP - 1 connection
SMTP - uses with IMAP/POP3
FTP - 2 Connections one control and one data [data send as non encrypted so its not secure and dont use mostly]
Socket - Specially need when server talk to client
