CAP -> Consistancy, Availability, Partition tolerance
> All three cant be achieve only pair of two is possible at a time

Consisitancy -> Assume A DB Nodes some data change then B DB Nodes data also need to change
Availability -> All nodes should response
Partition Tolerance -> If communication break betwween two DB then system will not down

now let have an example we have B and C two DB nodes now scenarios
1. AP -> B may return 4 and C may return 5
2. CP -> a DB node will remove between B and C
3. CA -> During communication break system will down


Normally in real world scenario partitaion tolerance cant be compromised so mostly we have to choose between CP or AP
