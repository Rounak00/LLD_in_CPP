# LLD in Java

## 🎯 Suggested Pattern Roadmap (with Java focus)

### 1. Creational Patterns – *How objects are created*
- **Singleton**.
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### 2. Structural Patterns – *How objects are composed*
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### 3. Behavioral Patterns – *How objects interact*
- **Observer** – Very common (used in GUI, event systems).
- **Strategy**
- **Command**
- **State**
- **Template Method**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Visitor**
- **Memento**
- **Interpreter**

## 💡 Why LLD in Java (and not C++)

While design patterns and LLD concepts are language-agnostic, **Java** offers:

- **Richer standard libraries** for collections, concurrency, and networking — reduces boilerplate.
- **Built-in memory management (Garbage Collection)** — lets you focus on design instead of manual memory handling.
- **Widespread use in enterprise applications** — many LLD interview problems are expected in Java/Spring context.
- **Better reflection and runtime type info** — simplifies implementing patterns like Factory, Proxy, or Observer.
- **Clearer syntax for OOP** — compared to C++, fewer pitfalls with smart pointers, destructors, and object slicing.

> **In short:** Java allows you to focus on **design**, not low-level memory and pointer management, making it ideal for demonstrating LLD skills in interviews.

> PS : I give DSA interviews in **CPP** only
