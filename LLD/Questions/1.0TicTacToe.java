plaingPiece just set the piece type
Player -> holds name and piece type set and get piece and name (although we set in constructor)
board -> add list, get free space, print board
tictactoe game -> main player creation and turn and also start game functionality, is There winner check
main -> new titactoe game and intitialixe with start game
